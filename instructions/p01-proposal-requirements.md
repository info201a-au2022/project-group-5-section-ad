# Instructions for P01: Project Proposal 

* **Where is the project brief?**  [`../instructions/project-design-brief.pdf`](../instructions/project-design-brief.pdf).
* **Making Progress**: We understand this project might be difficult. Also, we understand that your project ideas might not be completely worked out. So, we ask that you do the best you can. You will receive specific guidance from your TA and constructive feedback. We are confident that you will succeed! 
* **What should be included in the proposal?** Every proposal will be different. It depends on your particular project.  That said, in the table below you will find the **required** report elements.  It is important that you engage with and respond to the the Design Brief. 
* **How should the proposal be formatted?** You should format your proposal using Markdown. You should aim for a professional presentation - clear, concise, inclusive, interesting, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. 
* **What headings should we use?** As needed, the suggested headings below can be revised and new headings and sub-headings can be added. Please use headings, bullet lists, tables, figures, and other markdown code effectively - seek a professional presentation. 
* **Questions?** If you have questions, please ask your TA or post on Teams.

|Abstract | Our main question is if there is a correlation between video games and crime rates. This question is important because for years, people have been saying that if you play video games, you are likely to be a criminal. To address the question, we will be looking at data from each state, their most popular games and the amount of crimes committed. We are concerned with different factors that will contribute to the amount of crimes. To address this, we will look at the type of crimes that were committed, while also looking at the type of games that are being played in each states.|
|Keywords | Video games and crimes correlation? |
|Introduction | For years, people have associated with playing video games to violence, believing that people who play games are more likely to become criminals. Along with Post COVID, what people are saying has been an increase in crime rates, we would like to use this opportunity to see whther there is an correlation between gamers and crimes. (About 150 words.) |
|Problem Domain | Use short sub-sections to describe your topic and the setting (that is, the sociotechnical situation), including project framing, human values, direct and indirect stakeholders, possible harms and benefits. See the Design Brief, section B.3. **Note**: You *must* include three citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, reseach papers, etc. ). You may find it helpful to include a figure.  (About 400 words.) |
|Research Questions | 
- What is the most popular game in the state? This is an impostant question to ask because when people associate to violence, they talk about shooting games. We can see if there is an association between the type of games played and crime. 
- How many crimes are in each state? We need to see how many crimes are in each state to compare whether video games do increase crime rates.
- What type of crimes are most commmitted? This question should be asked because we need to see if the type of crimes that are committed is associated to the type of games that people play.
For each research question, you should discuss why it is important and what motivates the question. (About 50 words for each question, so for four questions you would write about 200 words or more if needed.) |
|The Dataset | **(1)** Describe how your dataset is related to your problem domain and, specifically, to your research qeustions. That is, how will your dataset enable you to answer your research questions? **(2)** Include a table that presents the name of each data file, the number of observations (rows), and the number of variables (columns). **(3)** Include a full citation to each data file, including URL. **(4)** Finally, describe the provenance of your dataset, addressing such key questions as: (a) Who collected the data? When? For what purpose? (b) How was the data collection effort funded? Who is likely to benefit from the data or make money? (c) How was the data validated and held secure?  Is it credible and trustworthy? (d) How did you obtain the data? Do you credit the source of the data? (About 400 words.) |
|Expected Implications | Proposal only. Assuming you answer your research questions, briefly describe the expected or possible implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers. (About 150 words.) |
|Limitations | There are many factors and types of crimes. Post COVID, there has been what is assumed as an increase in crime rates. However, factors that can play a role in this are police defunding and homeless rates. Because of this, it will be hard to tell if crime rates is truly associated to video games.|
|_Findings_ | _Not for the project proposal; for final report only. Give answers to each of your research questions. (About 400 words.)_ |
|_Discussion_ | _Not for the project proposal; for final report only. Discuss importance and/or implications of your findings  (About 400 words.)_ |
|_Conclusion_ | _Not for the project proposal; for final report only. Give the reader a summary point, the key point that you will like your audience to leave with. (About 400 words.)_ |
