|Abstract | Our main question is if there is a correlation between video games and crime rates. This question is important because for years, people have been saying that if you play video games, you are likely to be a criminal. To address the question, we will be looking at data from each state, their most popular games and the amount of crimes committed. We are concerned with different factors that will contribute to the amount of crimes. To address this, we will look at the type of crimes that were committed, while also looking at the type of games that are being played in each states.|

|Introduction | For years, people have associated with playing video games to violence, believing that people who play games are more likely to become criminals. Along with Post COVID, what people are saying has been an increase in crime rates, we would like to use this opportunity to see whther there is an correlation between gamers and crimes.

|Problem Domain | Use short sub-sections to describe your topic and the setting (that is, the sociotechnical situation), including project framing, human values, direct and indirect stakeholders, possible harms and benefits. See the Design Brief, section B.3. **Note**: You *must* include three citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, reseach papers, etc. ). You may find it helpful to include a figure.  (About 400 words.) |
|Research Questions | **(1)** What is the most popular game in the state? This is an impostant question to ask because when people associate to violence, they talk about shooting games. We can see if there is an association between the type of games played and crime. **(2)** How many crimes are in each state? We need to see how many crimes are in each state to compare whether video games do increase crime rates. **(3)** What type of crimes are most commmitted? This question should be asked because we need to see if the type of crimes that are committed is associated to the type of games that people play. |
|The Dataset | **(1)** Describe how your dataset is related to your problem domain and, specifically, to your research qeustions. That is, how will your dataset enable you to answer your research questions? **(2)** Include a table that presents the name of each data file, the number of observations (rows), and the number of variables (columns). **(3)** Include a full citation to each data file, including URL. **(4)** Finally, describe the provenance of your dataset, addressing such key questions as: (a) Who collected the data? When? For what purpose? (b) How was the data collection effort funded? Who is likely to benefit from the data or make money? (c) How was the data validated and held secure?  Is it credible and trustworthy? (d) How did you obtain the data? Do you credit the source of the data? (About 400 words.) |
|Expected Implications | The expected implication for policymakers is that with the report that we made, policymakers can make a policy according to help reduce crime rates. For the media, we are hoping that this research is able to change people's perspective on video games and crime rates, whether there is an association, more attention will be shown about the policy to make a difference. if there isn't, we should change our perspective on video games. |
|Limitations | There are many factors and types of crimes. Post COVID, there has been what is assumed as an increase in crime rates. However, factors that can play a role in this are police defunding and homeless rates. Because of this, it will be hard to tell if crime rates is truly associated to video games.|
