### Abstract:
Our main question is whether there is a correlation between video games and crime rates. This question is important because for years, people have been saying that if you play video games, you are likely to be a criminal. To address the question, we will be looking at data from each year for the United States, the most popular games and the amount of crimes committed. We are concerned with different factors that will contribute to the amount of crimes. To address this, we will look at the type of crimes that were committed, while also looking at the genre of games that are being played most each year to compare whether there is a correlation.

### Introduction:
For years, people have associated playing video games to violence, believing that people who play video games are more likely to become criminals. This has piqued the interest of the  research topic of “is video games a cause of crime rates?” To answer this question, we will have to look at two types of data. The first being the number of crimes that occurred in each year  in the United States. The second is the most popular game each year. With this data, we will be able to see if the genre of the game will have a factor in the number of crimes.

### Problem Domain
**Background:**
As a group collectively, we like to play games whether that be first-person shooters or party games on the Nintendo Switch. And recently there have been a lot of shootings and criminal activity that has been happening near the UW campus. We have all also heard that violent video games may cause an increase in violent behaviors in a person. So we were wondering if the violence from video games had any impact on whether that person affected by video games would commit a crime. 

**Direct and Indirect Stakeholders:**
The stakeholders in our situation are adolescents and the general public. In this case, adolescents are a direct stakeholder because the majority of the player base for most video games is adolescents. So they are the generation that is most susceptible to the violence that is in video games. Which can rub off into their personalities and potentially make them more violent. An indirect stakeholder in our project is the general public. The general public is a stakeholder because they will be the ones that are affected by the crimes that people make. People with very violent personalities and tendencies are more likely to commit crimes and hurt others.

**Human Values:**
With our research project we would like to create a safer environment in our community and see if there is a potential link between video games and crime rates. We would like to help our community by creating a visual diagram and report our findings about video games and their impact on violence and crime rates in our community. 

**Potential Benefits and Harms:**
Some potential benefits from our project would be to inform other people about video games and if there is a correlation between them with increased violence in a person. This way people are more informed about video games and increased violence in adolescents. A potential harm is that if we find a strong correlation between video games with increased violence and crimes, we might be stereotyping all people that play games as people that are violent and criminals. We may create a stigma against video games and gamers, which is something we would like to refrain from doing.

### Research Questions
- _(1)_ What is the most popular game each year in the United States? 
This is an important question to ask because not every game is a violence game. If we are able to see what the most popular game is each year, we are able to look at the genre of the game to see whether there is a correlation between the type of game that is being played and crimes.
- _(2)_ How many crimes are committed in the United States? 
We need to look at the amount of crimes in the United States because that is where the most attention is focused on on news outlets and researches. If there is an association between crimes and video games, we will see an increase in crime when 
- _(3)_ What type of crimes are most committed? 
This question should be asked because we need to see if the type of crimes that are committed is associated with the type of games that are being played the most. With this type of information, we are able to see whether video games are igniting the fuel to commit crimes, or that the type of crime that is being committed is taught by the video games they played. 

### The Dataset
The dataset that is being presented is related to our research questions because it answers the questions that are being asked. It includes the amount of crimes reported in the United States each year, what types of crimes were committed, and the most popular games each year. For our research, the data is collected by two organizations. The crime datas are collected by the “Federal Bureau of Investigation.” The video games data are collected by the organization NPD, a market research organization. The crime data is funded by taxes. However, NPD is funded by industries. The people who benefit the most through NPD are the industries who funded NPD, while crime data benefits the government officials. The datas are held secure and validated because higher up rely on the data to be accurate to use. For NPD, it is these big industries that rely on the data, for crime data, it is the government officials. We believe that the data are credible because the companies are being paid to give accurate data for the industries, helping the industry see what they are doing is working or not. We obtained the data through their respective websites. 

### Expected Implications
- From this research, we are hoping that policymakers will be able to see whether there is a correlation between video games and crimes, or not. If there is a correlation as the public believes, policymakers should change their policies on how to regulate video games.
- People who play video games have been getting a really bad reputation in the media. We hope that this study will change the media’s perspective if there isn’t a correlation between video games and crimes. However, if there is one, we hope that the media is able to bring awareness with data, instead of gossip. 

### Limitations
- The limitation of this research is that there are many factors to why people commit crime. This will make it hard for us to tell if there truly is an association between video games and crimes.To address this issue, we will look at the type of crimes that were committed that year to see whether the types of crimes that are committed are similar to the genre of the video games.
- Due to the nature of our research correlation does not mean causation. The psychology of mental health issues and criminology is complex with many confounding variables that is hard to isolate with our skill cap at this time. As a result our project would rely on research studies to prove/disprove our statistical data.
